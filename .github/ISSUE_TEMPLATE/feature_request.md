## Description:
Add a countdown timer to each game round. The player must guess the word before the timer runs out. If the timer reaches zero, the game ends and is counted as a loss.

Key Points:
- The timer starts when a new game begins.
- The remaining time is displayed prominently on the screen.
- If the player wins or loses before time runs out, the timer stops.
- If the timer reaches zero, the game ends automatically with a loss message.
- The timer duration can be configured (e.g., 60 seconds per round).
- Optionally, add visual or audio cues as the timer approaches zero.
